*Byte Code Verifier

**Class-Loader

*Which of the following is not a JAVA keyword? 
***null is a keyword ***True and False are values

*Default Value of all operator

*Ternary Operator(for validation we can use it)

*Primitive variable:

*Ref variable: default value will be null.it is not eligible for garbage collection,bcoz it will be in stack. Variable in heap can be eligble for garbage collection.if object is null & outside the method then it will be in heap. object inside call will be in heap.

****Garbage Collection, 2 basic memory:stack & heap. system.gc(); won't give immediate o/p. Mark&sweep algorithm.

*Static variable/method are also called static member/class level resource.If non-static then related to object(dynamic).

*Local variable:must be intialized, should be in methods & block.No garbage value concept comes in picture.It can not be used twice in same method.If we want to use it many times declare it as global.
*this. refers to instance variable.

****For loop/*******while loop(e.g:predict the answer)/if-else/*****switch-case(e.g:break statement will be missing in any case)

***Encapsulation- getter will have return type as ur variable type,no arg is needed for getter.

**Access Modifiers 

**Hierarchy of modifier: weaker access(private).Default can also be known as package-private(within the class any package can access).
*depericated(date)

*Local date in introduced in JAVA8.

***Enums based question

***Static import used for class which has only static method and variable.

***Default constructor is created by compiler once we compile the code.No argument constructor is created by programmer.

*javac will show only declartion of method, not the content of method.

*static intializers/static constructor/static block are used to intialized static variable(can be used by object or class name).

*constructor or setter method are used to intialize non-static varaible.

*finalize() will be executed before GC.

****enum with constructor.

***we can not use static and abstract together(compliation error).

****3 imp methods in object class are: equals, hashcode and toString(toString is explicitly called or called by object while prinitng).

*extendsearch

***final method, final class, final variable.
****Diff types of wrapper classes available.
*boxing & unboxing auto boxing and auto-unboxing.

***public class Employee {
	 public static void main(String [] args) {
		float a=(float) 1.6;
		short b= (short) a;
		System.out.println(b);
		  }
Output will be 1.

public class Employee {
	 public static void main(String [] args) {
		char a=126;
		//short b= (short) a;
		System.out.println(a);
		  }
		 }

Output will be ~.

******HashSet hs=new HashSet();

****We can not add object in TreeSet.Bcoz we can not arrange Objects in order.Then we need two interfaces comparator and comparable.
****java8 treeset will not allow null values.
